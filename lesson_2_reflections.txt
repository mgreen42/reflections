What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	You initialize a repository to create the working area for git. If you don’t set up this working area, then git has no boundaries in which to operate.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is like the loading zone for the git operation. The cool part about it is that you don’t have to include all the files in your repository to commit, because a lot of them mightn’t be relevant, or change with each commit.
	
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	Only put the files that have changed into the commit
